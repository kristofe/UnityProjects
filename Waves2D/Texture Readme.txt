This explains how to feed Unity textures made in a plugin

We do this by passing an array of pixel colors for the plugin to write into.
The plugin then just writes the pixel data. See TexturePlugin/Texture.cpp,
function UpdateTexture.

From the C# side we have to first create the texture.
See Texture Project/Assets/Plugins/TexturePlayback.cs.
Then each frame we pass the pixel array to the plugin, and update texture data with
the colors generated by the plugin.

As a performance optimization, we "pin" the color array in memory and pass direct
pointer to the data. This avoids costly marshaling of Color array.

See the source code and project folder for the full implementation.
Project files are provided for XCode 2.4 (Mac) and Visual Studio 2003 (Windows).
Also take a look at the plugins section in the manual.
